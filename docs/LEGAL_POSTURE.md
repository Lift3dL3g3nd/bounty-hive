## What it does
- Retrieves public program policy pages
- Normalizes scope and rule text into a structured schema
- Produces compliance/evidence artifacts

## What it does NOT do
- No port scanning, vulnerability scanning, exploitation, brute force, or DoS
- No credential testing, phishing, social engineering
- No stealth or persistence behavior

## Consent & Scope
- Passive actions (DNS/WHOIS) require:
  - lead/admin scope confirmation
  - signed scope receipt
  - per-action approval unless explicit auto-approve is enabled
