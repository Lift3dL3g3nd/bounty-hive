TRUST CONTRACT

Bounty-Hive Security Analysis Platform

Version: 1.0
Status: Binding Design Contract
Audience: Developers, Security Teams, Companies, Auditors

1. Purpose

Bounty-Hive exists to help developers and organizations identify security risk without creating new risk.

This document defines the non-negotiable guarantees that govern how Bounty-Hive is designed, implemented, and operated.

These guarantees are enforced through:

architecture

code

automated tests

output formats

project governance

If a change violates this contract, it is considered a defect — not a feature.

2. Core Safety Guarantees

Bounty-Hive WILL:

Perform passive, non-intrusive analysis only

Produce evidence-based findings, not attack tooling

Generate outputs safe for:

CI/CD systems

code review

audit and legal review

Provide deterministic, reproducible results

Maintain clear provenance for findings (when, how, by which tool)

Bounty-Hive WILL NOT:

Execute exploits

Generate weaponized payloads

Emit proof-of-concept exploit code

Perform active exploitation

Perform unauthorized network interaction

Escalate privileges

Bypass authentication or authorization controls

Collect or exfiltrate sensitive data

Store secrets, credentials, or private keys

Enable misuse against third parties

3. Findings Are Not Exploits

A finding in Bounty-Hive represents:

a detected risk condition

a pattern or indicator of a vulnerability

a location and classification of concern

A finding does not include:

exploit payloads

shellcode

reverse shells

weaponized scripts

step-by-step exploitation instructions

This separation is intentional and permanent.

4. Weaponization Control

Bounty-Hive is explicitly designed to prevent uncontrolled dissemination of exploit knowledge.

Accordingly:

Exploit weaponization is out of scope for the scanning engine

Any future proof-of-concept handling (if implemented) must:

be sealed

be access-controlled

be auditable

require explicit authorization

never be directly accessible to scanner users by default

This is a hard design boundary.

5. Passive-Only Enforcement

Bounty-Hive enforces passive behavior by design:

No exploitation frameworks

No active scanning payloads

No traffic mutation

No authentication attempts

No state-changing requests

Analysis focuses on:

source code

configuration

metadata

policies

static artifacts

normalized evidence

If an analysis would require interaction that could alter system state, it is rejected.

6. Output Safety & Evidence Integrity

All outputs generated by Bounty-Hive are:

Non-executable

Deterministic

Schema-validated

Free of embedded payloads

Safe to store, transmit, and archive

Supported formats (e.g., SARIF, JSON, PDF) are treated as public contracts and are not used to transport exploit material.

7. Auditability & Transparency

Bounty-Hive prioritizes auditability over opacity.

The project provides:

documented threat models

documented security posture

documented limitations

clear statements of what the tool will never do

Security through obscurity is rejected.

8. Trust Enforcement

This Trust Contract is enforced by:

automated tests that fail if violations are introduced

code review requirements

architectural separation of concerns

refusal to merge features that compromise safety guarantees

No feature request overrides this contract.

9. User Responsibility

Users of Bounty-Hive are responsible for:

complying with applicable laws and program scopes

using findings ethically and responsibly

ensuring authorization for analysis targets

Bounty-Hive intentionally limits capabilities to reduce the risk of misuse.

10. Commitment

The maintainers of Bounty-Hive commit to:

protecting users from accidental harm

protecting organizations from unnecessary risk

advancing responsible security research

refusing features that undermine trust, even if they are popular

Trust is not a marketing claim.
It is a design requirement.
