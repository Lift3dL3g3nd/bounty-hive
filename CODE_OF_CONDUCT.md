# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors, maintainers, and participants in the Bounty-Hive community pledge to foster an open, professional, ethical, and harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of experience level, background, or role.

Bounty-Hive exists to improve global security through **responsible vulnerability discovery, controlled disclosure, and non-weaponized research**. Participation in this project requires respect for that mission.

---

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Acting professionally, respectfully, and constructively
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
- Accepting feedback gracefully
- Prioritizing the safety and security of users, organizations, and data
- Following responsible disclosure practices
- Respecting project safeguards, guardrails, and audit processes

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, intimidation, threats, or abuse of any kind
- Publishing or requesting weaponized exploit instructions
- Attempting to bypass, weaken, or remove safety controls
- Pressuring maintainers or contributors for disclosure of sensitive artifacts
- Sharing confidential, redacted, or gated information outside authorized workflows
- Submitting malicious code, payloads, or logic intended to cause harm
- Attempting to reverse-engineer or extract protected engine internals
- Social engineering, coercion, or deceptive practices against contributors or organizations

## Security & Disclosure Expectations

Because this project operates in a security-sensitive domain, **additional standards apply**:

- **No exploit weaponization**: Proofs of concept, payloads, or step-by-step exploitation instructions must not be shared in public issues, pull requests, discussions, or documentation.
- **No leakage attempts**: Attempts to infer, extract, or reconstruct sensitive artifacts from redacted outputs are prohibited.
- **Controlled disclosure only**: Vulnerability details must follow the project’s defined lifecycle (created → validated → approved → purchased → delivered).
- **Respect guardrails**: Automated and manual safeguards are intentional and must not be bypassed or undermined.
- **Good-faith research only**: All participation must be defensive, ethical, and aligned with improving security—not exploiting it.

Violations of these principles are treated as **serious misconduct**.

---

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to:

- Remove or reject contributions that violate this Code of Conduct
- Lock or delete discussions that are abusive or unsafe
- Suspend or permanently ban contributors for misconduct
- Report behavior to appropriate authorities if legally required

## Enforcement Guidelines

Enforcement actions may include, but are not limited to:

1. **Correction** – Private or public clarification of expected behavior  
2. **Warning** – Formal warning for unacceptable conduct  
3. **Temporary Ban** – Temporary restriction from participation  
4. **Permanent Ban** – Permanent removal from the project and community  

Security-related violations may skip intermediate steps.

- Contact project maintainers through the designated security or governance channels

Reports will be reviewed promptly and handled with discretion.
